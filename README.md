### PIG DICE
Pig Dice is a game on a webpage.It involves two players, each with their own turn to play(roll the dice). The cumulative points for this game is 100.Each user is able to see the score for every roll of dice and a cumulative score for each round played. Each user can hold their score if they are satisfied with the points gained at that particular time. A particular user is alerted when the dice rolls to number 1; that means he/she cannot roll the dice until the alternate user takes their round. A user will be notified of the player who has won the game. In this case, a user who accumulates 100 points before the other is the winner.

### BDD (Behavior Driven Development)
- The program asks for the users names after which it creates two profiles. For example;
    Input: Player 1: ESAU <br>
    Input: Player 2: WAWERU
- The program ensures that only a single player can roll dice or hold at a time .For example;
    Input: Player 2 rolls when Player one is playing<br>
    Output: Player 2 button is disabled.
- When the dice rolls on number 1, the game automatically changes turns. For example;
    Input: Dice roll = 1<br>
    Output: Oops!Dice rolled on 1,turn over!
- The program maintains the player's score when they hold .For example;
    Input: Player 2 hold<br>
    Output: Both player1 and player2 buttons disabled.

- The program ends when either of the players accumulates 100 points. For example
    Input: Player 1 cumulative score >= 100 <br>
    Output: Game Over. Player 1 winner.
